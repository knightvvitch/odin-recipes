        <p>If you like your bread sweet, spiced, and denser than a neutron star, then you are in for one heck of a treat. This <a href="pumpkin-bread.html">Pumpkin Bread</a> is like an entire fall festival in your mouth!</p>
        <p>Here is where I tell you the story of growing up on my great-grandmother's farm and how she used to grow pumpkins so tender that you would think she was made of pumpkin herself. Us kids would gather 'round the hearth to munch on freshly roasted pumpkin seeds and spit the shells right into the fire! Ah, memories. Absolutely <s>hazardous</s> heartwarming. Then, the scent of cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon would waft into...wait, let me guess, you want me to get to the recipe already? You don't care about my life story and are only here so that you can make the <strong>best</strong> pumpkin bread this side of the county line? Sigh, <em>fine</em>. Here you go.</p>
