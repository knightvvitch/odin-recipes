        <h3>Got a chili contest coming up? Make this, and win at least a participation trophy.</h3>
        <p>Nothing like a bowl of steaming chili on a chilly Autumn day, am I right? Warm up those hands, heart, and belly with beans, ground meat, and veggies all spiced to perfection.</p>
        <p>I want to preface this recipe with the fact that I am going to call for ground turkey because I only eat poultry and seafood, but you're more than welcome to use a ground meat of your choosing...venison, beef, soy, mutton,...I think lobster might be pretty weird, but whatever floats your boat.</p>
